# SQL_queries_exercises_and_notes
In this repository, I put the notes and the exercises that I solved for the course *Master SQL For Data Science*.

There are two `.sql` files: one for creating the tables and one for the queries that involve the database.

Furthermore, there is a `.txt` file version of the two `.sql` files.
