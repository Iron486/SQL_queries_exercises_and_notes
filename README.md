# SQL_queries_exercises_and_notes
In this repository, I put the notes and the exercises that I solved during the course called *Master SQL For Data Science*.

There are two `.sql` files: one used for creating the tables and one for the queries.

Furthermore, there is a `.txt` file version of the two `.sql` files.
